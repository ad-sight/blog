We get asked this all the time - from agencies to small business owners. Especially when there are so many media suppliers across the country each with their own unique inventory of outdoor advertising assets you can rent, it can be difficult not only understanding whether or not the media purchases you made are the right fit for your campaign but also whether you paid a fair value. Through this blog post, we will break it down so you can make an well informed decision to maximize your return on your marketing spend. <br></p><p>Overall, there are three key factors: location, demographics, and billboard type.</p><h2 id="location"><strong>Location</strong></h2><p>Location, location, location! Depending on where your billboard is located, it can dramatically influence not only the amount of people who notice it but how long they pay attention to it. For example, in Toronto, having a billboard in a popular location like Yonge-Dundas Square would be prime. But despite the high foot fall and of course, the number of impressions to go with it, it is important to also be careful about the visibility of your billboard and the lighting. If it is tucked in an area where there is a lot of competing billboards or hidden behind a tree - that would make your advertising efforts not nearly as effective as it would have you picked a more optimal location. </p><h2 id="demographics"><strong>Demographics </strong><br></h2><p>The demographic of people likely to pass by a billboard plays a role in determining that billboard’s pricing. While this may be difficult on your own, at <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a>, we empower you with demographic metrics and provide you with all the tools you need to maximize the impact of your campaign. Demographics such as age, gender, and income are important for you to know and you will find that billboards in locations where buying power is higher tends to be more expensive. In other words, you can expect to pay more to advertise to people who are willing to buy more. <br></p><h2 id="type"><strong>Type </strong><br></h2><p>The type of billboard can impact your costs as well because of the billboard type and its associated installation costs. For example, physical billboards have different cost breakdowns compared to digital billboards. When you are choosing to advertise with physical billboards, you usually have to pay to print your advertisement on vinyl, a type of material used for billboard ads due to its weather resistance. Vinyl usually costs about 50 cents per square foot so printing an advertisement on vinyl for a 14 x 48 foot bulletin billboard requires almost 700 square foot of material and will cost anything between $300 and $500. <br></p><p>On the other hand, digital billboards do not require you to print your ad. In fact, you can change it whenever and can even target it towards specific audiences by showing certain advertisements at specified times during a day, they are more expensive overall for those very reasons. We will dive into the benefits and limitations of each in our next blog post, but these are some high level considerations you can start out with when determining which is a better fit for you. <br></p><h2 id="so-how-much-do-they-typically-cost"><strong>So, how much do they typically cost?</strong></h2><p>Billboards in Canada range from $400 per month all the way up to $5000 per month for digital billboards in very high traffic locations. That is why billboards are known to be so cost effective. <br></p><p>If you are interested in billboard advertising, we recommend you take a look around <a href="adsight.ca/blog/how-much-does-billboard-advertising-cost/app.adsight.ca">Adsight</a>. With our technology, you can discover media inventory across Canada with a touch of a button with all the information needed to empower you to decide whether outdoor advertising is right for you. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[OOH Advertising post Covid-19]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As many provinces in Canada enter into phase 2 of the re-opening process, many businesses and organizations are waking from the past three month slumber of inactivity.

In the consumer marketplace, we are seeing pent up demand from individuals who are eager to shop, eat at restaurants and support small local businesses. <br></p><p>However, travel is one of the industries that might find it difficult to completely rebound this year as many people surveyed still feel uncertain about the safety aspects. Provincial health officers in Canada are now encouraging citizens to do more stay-vacations or limited travel to local tourist destinations. For us in BC, one of the hottest destinations in Vancouver to travel to is Whistler, where it transforms into beautiful nature activities in the summer. <br></p><p>With an expected increase in provincial and inter-city travel this summer, advertisers should be looking at out-of-home advertising solutions along frequent traffic locations such as the Sea-to-Sky corridor driving up from Whistler or Squamish city, a typical pit stop for travellers to Whistler mountain with its own unique attractions and sites. As more and more people slowly exit their isolation from home, OOH will become even more crucial as a direct marketing tool that cannot be ignored.<br></p><p>If you want to explore how Adsight can help you navigate OOH advertising, shoot us an e-mail <a href="mailto:sales@adsight.ca">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summer 2020 OOH Trends]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Even as lockdown restrictions are lifting and airlines, hotels, cruise ships are actively incentivizing Canadians to travel across the country and overseas again, most Canadians have their eyes on local trips.

In fact, B.C. Parks reservation site crashed this past week after 50,000 people tried booking at once. <br></p><p>High traffic areas such Toronto’s Union station and Vancouver’s Granville station have historically been prime advertising areas. But as Canadians are choosing to travel within their own provinces this summer, media assets on popular highways and on locations situated near local travel destinations will likely see an enormous spike in impressions. <br></p><p>However, renting billboard space can be a confusing process — especially for smaller advertisers. Through platforms like <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a>, advertisers can easily search and purchase media assets that are the best fit for their businesses. Our partners such as Prime Signs, Marquis, and Wild on Media have great locations to choose from. For advertisers who are looking to expand their reach cost-effectively, OOH advertising cannot come at a better time.

While shares, clicks, and likes are integral especially in this day and age, they still do not displace the unique benefits OOH brings. Here are the top four benefits of OOH Advertising: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li><strong>OOH delivers on mass reach cost-effectively</strong><br>
A typical OOH broadcast campaign can reach the majority of the population within days and 80%+ of any audience within two weeks <sup>1</sup>. OOH is actually right behind TV in speed of impact, making national-level coverage very cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>OOH is an exceptional tool for long-term brand building</strong><br>
With its far reach and exposure, OOH advertising helps build long-term brand equity and drives top-of-mind brand awareness. Research shared in Campaign<sup>2</sup> shows that mobile click-through rates increase by up to 15% when supported by OOH. Moreover, research from Outsmart shows that OOH activity drives a 17% lift in smartphone actions, further demonstrating the impact of OOH.</li>
<li><strong>It has less noise to cut through</strong><br>
The average person today sees 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day - most of them being online<sup>3</sup>. In fact, the influx of advertisements have pushed 47% of consumers to block ads<sup>4</sup>. Users are so ad-adverse that there is even a term coined called “Banner Blindness” that describes the phenomenon that occurs when users unconsciously ignore banner-like information because they’re associated with ads.</li>
<li><strong>When creative, it pays dividends</strong><br>
According to a 2018 insight from Nielsen, 1 in 4 Americans has posted an image of an outdoor ad to Instagram<sup>5</sup>. Bold OOH ideas grab attention and can create a powerful, emotional impact with users who will then become earned media. Especially when the physical spaces are leveraged to create culture and artforms, OOH advertising can be an excellent tool for engagement.</li>

After being in the marketing industry for over 10 years combined, our co-founders saw a gap in the market where technology could help not only address these issues but propel the industry forward exponentially. It started with a simple question, when you pass a billboard, do you know how much it typically costs to book? What about the amount of traffic or impressions it generates? Who are the type of people that live in that neighbourhood or what is the audience profile? We quickly realized that there was a serious lack of transparency surrounding the industry, most businesses thought that only the biggest advertisers like Coca-Cola or McDonalds could afford to advertise on fancy billboards and displays. Even if you wanted to look into booking inventory, you have to track down the right media supplier who owns that particular display, go through a lengthy and time-consuming process to outline your requirements with a sales rep and solidify the booking. Our team realized there had to be a better management and booking solution for the tens of thousands of billboards and inventories across Canada - that is how <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a> was born.</p><p>Adsight is not only an innovative discovery platform for agencies and brands looking to plan and advertise effectively in the out-of-home marketplace, but we also provide tremendous value for our media supplier partners. By allowing a media supplier to list, aggregate and market their inventory in one accessible, easy-to-use online platform, we aim to increase their business incrementally. Some of the benefits Adsight provides to media owners is additional revenues, lower vacancy rates, interactive mapping features, custom dashboards and inventory management systems.</p><p>Today, we are proud and excited to announce that after two months of continuous development, countless feedback sessions, extensive research and preparation, our beta version is now active with the support of our partners. We invite you to check out our <a href="https://app.adsight.ca">Adsight platform</a> and see the difference we can make.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

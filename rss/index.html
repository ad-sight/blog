In fact, B.C. Parks reservation site crashed this past week after 50,000 people tried booking at once. <br></p><p>High traffic areas such Toronto’s Union station and Vancouver’s Granville station have historically been prime advertising areas. But as Canadians are choosing to travel within their own provinces this summer, media assets on popular highways and on locations situated near local travel destinations will likely see an enormous spike in impressions. <br></p><p>However, renting billboard space can be a confusing process — especially for smaller advertisers. Through platforms like <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a>, advertisers can easily search and purchase media assets that are the best fit for their businesses. Our partners such as Prime Signs, Marquis, and Wild on Media have great locations to choose from. For advertisers who are looking to expand their reach cost-effectively, OOH advertising cannot come at a better time.

While shares, clicks, and likes are integral especially in this day and age, they still do not displace the unique benefits OOH brings. Here are the top four benefits of OOH Advertising: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li><strong>OOH delivers on mass reach cost-effectively</strong><br>
A typical OOH broadcast campaign can reach the majority of the population within days and 80%+ of any audience within two weeks <sup>1</sup>. OOH is actually right behind TV in speed of impact, making national-level coverage very cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>OOH is an exceptional tool for long-term brand building</strong><br>
With its far reach and exposure, OOH advertising helps build long-term brand equity and drives top-of-mind brand awareness. Research shared in Campaign<sup>2</sup> shows that mobile click-through rates increase by up to 15% when supported by OOH. Moreover, research from Outsmart shows that OOH activity drives a 17% lift in smartphone actions, further demonstrating the impact of OOH.</li>
<li><strong>It has less noise to cut through</strong><br>
The average person today sees 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day - most of them being online<sup>3</sup>. In fact, the influx of advertisements have pushed 47% of consumers to block ads<sup>4</sup>. Users are so ad-adverse that there is even a term coined called “Banner Blindness” that describes the phenomenon that occurs when users unconsciously ignore banner-like information because they’re associated with ads.</li>
<li><strong>When creative, it pays dividends</strong><br>
According to a 2018 insight from Nielsen, 1 in 4 Americans has posted an image of an outdoor ad to Instagram<sup>5</sup>. Bold OOH ideas grab attention and can create a powerful, emotional impact with users who will then become earned media. Especially when the physical spaces are leveraged to create culture and artforms, OOH advertising can be an excellent tool for engagement.</li>

After being in the marketing industry for over 10 years combined, our co-founders saw a gap in the market where technology could help not only address these issues but propel the industry forward exponentially. It started with a simple question, when you pass a billboard, do you know how much it typically costs to book? What about the amount of traffic or impressions it generates? Who are the type of people that live in that neighbourhood or what is the audience profile? We quickly realized that there was a serious lack of transparency surrounding the industry, most businesses thought that only the biggest advertisers like Coca-Cola or McDonalds could afford to advertise on fancy billboards and displays. Even if you wanted to look into booking inventory, you have to track down the right media supplier who owns that particular display, go through a lengthy and time-consuming process to outline your requirements with a sales rep and solidify the booking. Our team realized there had to be a better management and booking solution for the tens of thousands of billboards and inventories across Canada - that is how <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a> was born.</p><p>Adsight is not only an innovative discovery platform for agencies and brands looking to plan and advertise effectively in the out-of-home marketplace, but we also provide tremendous value for our media supplier partners. By allowing a media supplier to list, aggregate and market their inventory in one accessible, easy-to-use online platform, we aim to increase their business incrementally. Some of the benefits Adsight provides to media owners is additional revenues, lower vacancy rates, interactive mapping features, custom dashboards and inventory management systems.</p><p>Today, we are proud and excited to announce that after two months of continuous development, countless feedback sessions, extensive research and preparation, our beta version is now active with the support of our partners. We invite you to check out our <a href="https://app.adsight.ca">Adsight platform</a> and see the difference we can make.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

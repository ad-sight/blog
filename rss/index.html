The country now has 2.4 million confirmed infections - more than any other country. They are not alone; countries such as Brazil, Russia, India - to name a few, have seen a large uptick in cases. <br>Even in countries such as Canada, which saw the lowest single day increase in COVID-19 related deaths in months, are worried about the potential of a second wave. Amidst the fight against social injustice and a precarious economic situation, it is no surprise that marketers are carefully navigating the consumer landscape.</p><p>While it may be intimidating to strike a balance between being authentic and being on brand, this is not the time for brands to disappear and go dark - if anything, consumers are looking to be supported, entertained, and acknowledged more than ever.  </p><h1 id="be-present-and-uniquely-helpful"><strong>Be present and uniquely helpful </strong><br></h1><p>P&amp;G, for example, recently launched their ad “The Choice”. In this simple 75-second advertisement, it shows close-ups of people’s skin and faces as the backdrop of extremely powerful copy urging white Americans to use their power to become anti-racist. The ad ends with a clear call to action for viewers to visit a website filled with resources to take action. <br></p><p>While being present is integral, we also want to caution against jumping on the bandwagon just because. Slapping on a few vague sentences and a logo is not only adding no value, but it is  extremely counterproductive as consumers are already very sensitive about brands that are latching onto this movement as a way to self-promote.</p><h1 id="be-empowering-and-empathetic"><strong>Be empowering and empathetic </strong></h1><p>Orlando Wood, Chief Innovation Officer at global research firm Systeml Group found in new research that brands that empower consumers to “live their fullest life are connecting very well.” He also found that, on the contrary, brands that are telling people to act a certain way or think a certain way are not perceived very positively because the essence of the messaging hinges on inhibiting a way of life. <br></p><p>Apple’s “Creativity Goes On” advertisement is an excellent example of a brand that has been able to strike that balance. Produced in just two weeks, the ad features footages of people of all ages using Apple products to entertain, connect, and inspire each other. Set to a piano track, the ad features users creating video content, practicing live yoga classes, and playing chess over video call. In addition, it features celebrities such as Oprah offering words of support on Apple TV+, John Krasinski working on his YouTube show #SomeGoodNews, and actress Lily James’s involvement with the #SaveWithStories children’s book initiative with her iPad. Apple was able to showcase its products while empowering users to reach inside their inner creative to raise each other up.</p><h1 id="be-relevant"><strong>Be relevant </strong></h1><p>It is integral to recognize how your target market’s outlook has changed and what type of messaging they are connecting well with. Wood’s research also shows that advertisements that are outperforming tend to be more right-brained in nature. According to their research, advertising since 2006 has become more abstract as they focus on self-image, performance, materialism, and are highly reliant on words and rhythm. In times of crisis, people have a heightened sense of awareness and longing for human connection and will be less receptive to left-brained messaging that revolves around things and logic. To stay relevant, it is integral for brands to reconsider their messaging and find ways to go outside of the comfortable realm of left-brained advertising. <br></p><p>For example, Truly Hard Seltzer is celebrating pride through a year long partnership with GLAAD, a nonprofit organization promoting understanding and advancing equality for the LGBTQ+ community. They are donating $100,000 to GLAAD and are launching a social campaign by taking over the Times Square billboard to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the New York City Pride March, which was cancelled due to the pandemic. People are incentivized to submit photos to @Truly of how they are celebrating Pride month with the hashtag #TrulyPride for a chance to be included on the billboard. In addition, Truly is sharing 16 stories, one for each of its 16 flavours, to offer new perspectives and celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. <br></p><p>Leveraging outdoor media is an effective way for brands, businesses, communities to speak up. We frequently think of advertisements as ways to increase one’s top-line. Especially during this time, when our lives may be disrupted, when our mental models may be undergoing drastic</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><small>1.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53191287 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53191287"></a></small>

As we watched, people of all ethnicities and cultures marched together in solidarity, and many brands and businesses also chose to not stay silent on this important issue. An example we found was the “Black Heart” Full of Love campaign done by Outfront Media across their digital signage network. Something so simple, no words, just an illustration to demonstrate their support. The design of the heart and the use of colors clearly portrays this message of unity but the heart also symbolizes love, hope, compassion and peace.<br></p><p>There are so many ways to be creative and leverage the power of OOH advertising. Even in the age of digital media where we can literally hone in and target very specific traits, OOH assets cannot be ignored the moment you step out of your home and commute. There is now a greater emphasis and importance for the media suppliers and advertisers to capture this opportunity as restrictions start easing and more people are encouraged to travel within their own territories.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Much Does Billboard Advertising Cost?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="making-an-informed-decision"><strong>Making an informed decision</strong></h2><p>Ever walked by an amazing billboard and wonder how much it would cost to get your campaign on there?

We get asked this all the time - from agencies to small business owners. Especially when there are so many media suppliers across the country each with their own unique inventory of outdoor advertising assets you can rent, it can be difficult not only understanding whether or not the media purchases you made are the right fit for your campaign but also whether you paid a fair value. Through this blog post, we will break it down so you can make an well informed decision to maximize your return on your marketing spend. <br></p><p>Overall, there are three key factors: location, demographics, and billboard type.</p><h2 id="location"><strong>Location</strong></h2><p>Location, location, location! Depending on where your billboard is located, it can dramatically influence not only the amount of people who notice it but how long they pay attention to it. For example, in Toronto, having a billboard in a popular location like Yonge-Dundas Square would be prime. But despite the high foot fall and of course, the number of impressions to go with it, it is important to also be careful about the visibility of your billboard and the lighting. If it is tucked in an area where there is a lot of competing billboards or hidden behind a tree - that would make your advertising efforts not nearly as effective as it would have you picked a more optimal location. </p><h2 id="demographics"><strong>Demographics </strong><br></h2><p>The demographic of people likely to pass by a billboard plays a role in determining that billboard’s pricing. While this may be difficult on your own, at <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a>, we empower you with demographic metrics and provide you with all the tools you need to maximize the impact of your campaign. Demographics such as age, gender, and income are important for you to know and you will find that billboards in locations where buying power is higher tends to be more expensive. In other words, you can expect to pay more to advertise to people who are willing to buy more. <br></p><h2 id="type"><strong>Type </strong><br></h2><p>The type of billboard can impact your costs as well because of the billboard type and its associated installation costs. For example, physical billboards have different cost breakdowns compared to digital billboards. When you are choosing to advertise with physical billboards, you usually have to pay to print your advertisement on vinyl, a type of material used for billboard ads due to its weather resistance. Vinyl usually costs about 50 cents per square foot so printing an advertisement on vinyl for a 14 x 48 foot bulletin billboard requires almost 700 square foot of material and will cost anything between $300 and $500. <br></p><p>On the other hand, digital billboards do not require you to print your ad. In fact, you can change it whenever and can even target it towards specific audiences by showing certain advertisements at specified times during a day, they are more expensive overall for those very reasons. We will dive into the benefits and limitations of each in our next blog post, but these are some high level considerations you can start out with when determining which is a better fit for you. <br></p><h2 id="so-how-much-do-they-typically-cost"><strong>So, how much do they typically cost?</strong></h2><p>Billboards in Canada range from $400 per month all the way up to $5000 per month for digital billboards in very high traffic locations. That is why billboards are known to be so cost effective. <br></p><p>If you are interested in billboard advertising, we recommend you take a look around <a href="adsight.ca/blog/how-much-does-billboard-advertising-cost/app.adsight.ca">Adsight</a>. With our technology, you can discover media inventory across Canada with a touch of a button with all the information needed to empower you to decide whether outdoor advertising is right for you. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[OOH Advertising post Covid-19]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As many provinces in Canada enter into phase 2 of the re-opening process, many businesses and organizations are waking from the past three month slumber of inactivity.

In the consumer marketplace, we are seeing pent up demand from individuals who are eager to shop, eat at restaurants and support small local businesses. <br></p><p>However, travel is one of the industries that might find it difficult to completely rebound this year as many people surveyed still feel uncertain about the safety aspects. Provincial health officers in Canada are now encouraging citizens to do more stay-vacations or limited travel to local tourist destinations. For us in BC, one of the hottest destinations in Vancouver to travel to is Whistler, where it transforms into beautiful nature activities in the summer. <br></p><p>With an expected increase in provincial and inter-city travel this summer, advertisers should be looking at out-of-home advertising solutions along frequent traffic locations such as the Sea-to-Sky corridor driving up from Whistler or Squamish city, a typical pit stop for travellers to Whistler mountain with its own unique attractions and sites. As more and more people slowly exit their isolation from home, OOH will become even more crucial as a direct marketing tool that cannot be ignored.<br></p><p>If you want to explore how Adsight can help you navigate OOH advertising, shoot us an e-mail <a href="mailto:sales@adsight.ca">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summer 2020 OOH Trends]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Even as lockdown restrictions are lifting and airlines, hotels, cruise ships are actively incentivizing Canadians to travel across the country and overseas again, most Canadians have their eyes on local trips.

In fact, B.C. Parks reservation site crashed this past week after 50,000 people tried booking at once. <br></p><p>High traffic areas such Toronto’s Union station and Vancouver’s Granville station have historically been prime advertising areas. But as Canadians are choosing to travel within their own provinces this summer, media assets on popular highways and on locations situated near local travel destinations will likely see an enormous spike in impressions. <br></p><p>However, renting billboard space can be a confusing process — especially for smaller advertisers. Through platforms like <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a>, advertisers can easily search and purchase media assets that are the best fit for their businesses. Our partners such as Prime Signs, Marquis, and Wild on Media have great locations to choose from.

While shares, clicks, and likes are integral especially in this day and age, they still do not displace the unique benefits OOH brings. Here are the top four benefits of OOH Advertising: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li><strong>OOH delivers on mass reach cost-effectively</strong><br>
A typical OOH broadcast campaign can reach the majority of the population within days and 80%+ of any audience within two weeks <sup>1</sup>. OOH is actually right behind TV in speed of impact, making national-level coverage very cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>OOH is an exceptional tool for long-term brand building</strong><br>
With its far reach and exposure, OOH advertising helps build long-term brand equity and drives top-of-mind brand awareness. Research shared in Campaign<sup>2</sup> shows that mobile click-through rates increase by up to 15% when supported by OOH. Moreover, research from Outsmart shows that OOH activity drives a 17% lift in smartphone actions, further demonstrating the impact of OOH.</li>
<li><strong>It has less noise to cut through</strong><br>
The average person today sees 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day - most of them being online<sup>3</sup>. In fact, the influx of advertisements have pushed 47% of consumers to block ads<sup>4</sup>. Users are so ad-adverse that there is even a term coined called “Banner Blindness” that describes the phenomenon that occurs when users unconsciously ignore banner-like information because they’re associated with ads.</li>
<li><strong>When creative, it pays dividends</strong><br>
According to a 2018 insight from Nielsen, 1 in 4 Americans has posted an image of an outdoor ad to Instagram<sup>5</sup>. Bold OOH ideas grab attention and can create a powerful, emotional impact with users who will then become earned media. Especially when the physical spaces are leveraged to create culture and artforms, OOH advertising can be an excellent tool for engagement.</li>

After being in the marketing industry for over 10 years combined, our co-founders saw a gap in the market where technology could help not only address these issues but propel the industry forward exponentially. It started with a simple question, when you pass a billboard, do you know how much it typically costs to book? What about the amount of traffic or impressions it generates? Who are the type of people that live in that neighbourhood or what is the audience profile? We quickly realized that there was a serious lack of transparency surrounding the industry, most businesses thought that only the biggest advertisers like Coca-Cola or McDonalds could afford to advertise on fancy billboards and displays. Even if you wanted to look into booking inventory, you have to track down the right media supplier who owns that particular display, go through a lengthy and time-consuming process to outline your requirements with a sales rep and solidify the booking. Our team realized there had to be a better management and booking solution for the tens of thousands of billboards and inventories across Canada - that is how <a href="https://adsight.ca">Adsight</a> was born.</p><p>Adsight is not only an innovative discovery platform for agencies and brands looking to plan and advertise effectively in the out-of-home marketplace, but we also provide tremendous value for our media supplier partners. By allowing a media supplier to list, aggregate and market their inventory in one accessible, easy-to-use online platform, we aim to increase their business incrementally. Some of the benefits Adsight provides to media owners is additional revenues, lower vacancy rates, interactive mapping features, custom dashboards and inventory management systems.</p><p>Today, we are proud and excited to announce that after two months of continuous development, countless feedback sessions, extensive research and preparation, our beta version is now active with the support of our partners. We invite you to check out our <a href="https://app.adsight.ca">Adsight platform</a> and see the difference we can make.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
